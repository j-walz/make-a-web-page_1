      <p>The <b>internet</b> is the worlds largest network of computers. Basically it is just a web for computers
        <br> to talk to other computers, but on a giant scale. The <b>user</b> will get on a <b>browser</b> and send a request
        <br> over the <b>internet</b> to a <b>web server</b> that is hosting what ever information the <b>user</b> wants. The <b>web server</b>
        <br> then repsonds to the <b>user</b> with the information request and sends it back across the <b>internet</b> to appear on the <b>user's browser</b>.</p>

    <!--The p tag is to set paragraphs.  It is a block tag.  The b tag sets the text to bold and is an inline tag.  The br tag puts a new line (/n) and is an inline tag as well. -->

      <h2><a id="html">HTML</a></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p><em>HTML</em> is the basic language of the internet. Almost all of the web pages on the internet are written using
        <em>HTML</em>.
        <br><em>HTML</em> documents can contain links, images, text, video, and much more. The way that these different elements
        <br> of an <em>HTML</em> document are written into the document are with
        <em>tags</em>. <em>Tags</em> are markers that notify the <em>HTML</em> document
        <br> that a specified set of text is not just text but an insrtuction of how to treat other sets of text. <em>Tags</em> are surrounded by &lt; and &gt;
        <br> with the closing <em>tag</em> having a / infront of it. This is so the <em>HTML</em> document knows how to treat that text, and then the <em>tags</em>
        <br> themselves surround the bit of text that they are affecting. An example of a <em>tag</em> is the b tag, which tells the <em>HTML</em> document
        <br> that all of the text inbetween the opening and closing b tags should be bold.</p>
      <p>Together a <em>tag</em> and the text that that<em>tag</em> is affecting are called and <em>element</em>. There are two types of <em>elements</em>, <em>inline</em>
        <br> and <em>block</em>. <em>Inline elements</em> keep the element within the line of text and do not add anything extra to the text.
        <br> <em>Block elements</em> put an invisible box around the text that the writer can use to set that bit of text apart from others.
    </div>
    <!--The em tag is the emphasis tag.  It puts the affected text in italics.  It is an inline element. -->

      <h2><a id="think">Thinking Like a Computer</a></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>Computers do exactly what they are told, but what they are told is not always what is meant. To have think like
        <br> a computer is to be able to think in systematic steps. One must take everything one step at a time and without
        <br> assuming any intetnion that may seemt to be built into the intrusction. This can be fairly difficult and requires much practice.

      <h2><a id="document">The Document Object Model</a></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>The <b>Document Object Model</b>, or <b>DOM</b>, is how web browsers interperit <em>html</em> files like this one. An <em>html</em> page is not written in some bizaar language, rather it is just written using a particular structure that allows browsers
        to understand what the author intends. The <b>DOM</b> is a branched structure, having elements branch to other elements which may in turn branch off further and further. Not only does this allow for browers to read <em>html</em> documents it is
        also fairly easliy understood by the human eye.</p>

      <h2><a id="tools">Developer Tools</a></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>The broswer Google Chrome has a usefull feature in the <b>Developer Tools</b>. They allow the user to inspect the elements of what ever web page he or she is viewing. If a person who is starting out in fron end web development is stuck or sees an
        interesting feature on a web page, than that person can utilize the <b>Developer
                           Tools</b> to see what kind of <em>tag, css,</em> and or <em>java script</em> was used to produce the desired effect.</p>

    <div class="header">
      <h2><a id="text">Text Editors</a></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p><b>Text Editors</b> are a great tool for programmers. They help the programmer by keeping him or her in line with the <em>DOM</em> and grammatical structure of what ever language is being used</p>
    </div>
    <div class="header">
      <h2><a id="html_boxes">HTML and Boxes</a></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>When one is looking at a web page, especially a good one, many shapes and design features will become apparent. However, looks may be deceiving. All of the elements display on an <b>HTML</b> page are actually
        <b>boxes</b>. Though one may see a circle or a triangle, those shapes are contained in <b>boxes</b>. This makes it much easier for prgrammers to plan and lay out a web page as well as rearrange it if neccesary.</p>

      <h2><a id="repitition">Avoid Repition</a></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>Writing a program or creating a web page can be very time consuming and tedious. Becuase of that fact it is important for programmers to avoid repition as much as possible so as not to add to their already burdensome task. In avoiding rewriting
        the same code over and over consistency and the ability to change large portions of code are gained. By reusing a trusted piece of code programmers can be assuered that what they are writing will be good.</p>

    <div class="header">
      <h2><a id="css">CSS</a></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language used to add style to HTML web pages. With CSS a programmer can take a bland and uniteresting web page and turn it into a colorful and attention grabbing web page.</p>
